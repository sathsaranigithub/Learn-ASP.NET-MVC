## ‚öôÔ∏è How MVC Works (ASP.NET MVC Flow)

1. **User** sends a request to the **Controller** through the browser (for example, `/Service/Details/1`).
2. The **Controller** receives the request and interacts with the **Model** if data is needed.
3. The **Model** communicates with the **Database** to fetch or update data.
4. The **Database** sends the data back to the **Model**.
5. The **Model** sends the data back to the **Controller**.
6. The **Controller** passes the data to the **View**.
7. The **View** displays the data to the **User** as a web page.
